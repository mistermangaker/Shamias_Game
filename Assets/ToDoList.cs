    //todo:
    //rework interaction system. currently its extremely disjointed. needs a better design.
    // design the tools and items
    // add tilling
    // a lot of things need to be decoupled. everything is a mess.
    // incoroporate and event bus. the constructionlayer manager needs to be able to recieve information about the players held items without directy looking at the players held items
    // rework the shop system to look better. one side for the shop and one side for the player
    // the buildings need proper animations and visuals.
    // the weather and game light manager need to be ported properly to 3d.
    // the game needs a way to dynamically populate the game world on new game start and also for spawning in new things like foragables.
    // finally implement the sceneloading manager.
    // rework the game database so that it is a static class.
    // dedicated scene Managers and UI and dynamically bootstrap them for better scene managerment
    // configs menu
    // start screen
    // new game options
    // add in all of the starting items -- doneish
    // seeded randomness
    // needs enemies
    // needs combat
    // needs crafting
    // needs player status like health, stats, and a centralized player manager script
    // sounds in general

    // priority:
    // event bus - added - needs expanding
    // interaction system rework -- after more work it seems fine
    // construction layer manager rework -- done
    // database rework -- done
    // weather and lighting fix -- waiting a bit more for this
    // dynamic world population system -- most done
    // sceneloading manager
